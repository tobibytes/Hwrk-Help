# Build Plan and Task Tracker

This file is the single source of truth for the build order. The AI works task by task, creates a branch, opens a PR, and marks each task as done in `docs/tasks.json` after merge.

You can run the app at each step and see something on screen or via a health endpoint.

## How to use this file

- The agent takes the next task with status todo
- Creates a branch named as specified in the task
- Follows the steps and acceptance checks
- Opens a PR with the title and body template
- After you merge, the agent flips the task to done in `docs/tasks.json` and continues

## Conventions

- Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
- Frontend is React with Vite and React Router
- No Tailwind
- Shared UI primitives live in `packages/talvra-ui` and are the only place where raw HTML tags exist
- Frontend uses `@tanstack/react-query` and a typed `useAPI` hook in `packages/talvra-api`
- Backend is microservices. Database is Neon Postgres. Storage is Azure Blob. Queue is Redis Streams
- No ORM. SQL migrations live under `/migrations/<bounded_context>`
- Process rules live in `docs/process.md` and `docs/process.json`. A validator ensures the JSON stays valid
